We have made great progress towards our fundraising efforts thanks to the generous donations of 39 brothers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every donation, no matter the size, will make a difference. We still need your help to reach our goal of $90K which will reposition our Chapter back to our pre-pandemic financial levels so we can tackle much needed maintenance work on our properties, reinforce our recruitment efforts to attract a new generation of Brothers, and strengthen our scholarship funds to provide support for our undergraduate Brothers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID Relief Fundraiser Update</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/covid-relief-fundraiser-update-2022-06-28/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jun 2022 17:36:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/covid-relief-fundraiser-update-2022-06-28/</guid><description>&lt;p>We wanted to personally thank you for your recent donations to our COVID-19 Relief Fundraiser. We are happy to announce that with the generous donations that we have received thus far over these past few weeks we have already met our first goal of raising over $36K! These funds will provide much needed support to our Chapter as we recover from this crisis, and we are well on our way of ensuring that Alpha Chi Rho will always be there for our alumni Brothers, our current undergraduate Brothers, and our future Brothers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>COVID Relief Fundraiser</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/covid-relief-fundraiser-2022-06-16/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jun 2022 17:36:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/covid-relief-fundraiser-2022-06-16/</guid><description>&lt;p>The COVID-19 Pandemic has caused a major adverse effect on the livelihood of our Chapter at RPI over the past two years. Membership numbers have been dwindling due to increased difficulties in recruitment during the pandemic. Both the pandemic and RPI’s policies have reduced the number of Brothers currently living in our Houses creating significant detrimental consequences on both the fraternal and financial aspects of our Chapter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the initial stages of the pandemic in Spring 2020, all students were sent home and thus the Building Association was unable to collect rent. Furthermore, the following year, Fall 2020-Spring 2021, RPI adopted online classes, so most of the undergraduate Brothers did not return to the Chapter, and again minimal rent was collected. Further exacerbating the lack of income, recruitment efforts over these semesters were very difficult and more Brothers graduated than have been newly initiated. The Building Association has taken a massive loss in finances over these past two years as we continue to pay for our required expenses and receive minimal income through rent.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spring 2022 Building Association Meeting</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/spring-2022-ba-meeting-wrapup/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Apr 2022 17:36:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/spring-2022-ba-meeting-wrapup/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Building Association held its semi-annual general meeting fully virtually via Zoom on 4/24/2022, with 23 Brothers in attendance.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grad Weekend Fall 2021</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/grad-weekend-fall-21/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 12:12:36 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/news/grad-weekend-fall-21/</guid><description>&lt;p>The RCAF and Delta Phi of Alpha Chi Rho Building Association successfully hosted the bi-annual Grad Weekend event on November 7, 2021.

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Waitings&lt;/strong> – Many fraternities have cooks that they pay to come to their house and prepare their meals for them. Others have catering services that bring them their meals. At our house, we strive to be self-sufficient so we adhere to a system in which every brother is required to be a “waiter” one day a week. We normally have 4 or 5 people waiting each day dinner is served. These people are required to prepare a healthy meal for the rest of the people on the meal plan (usually around 30 people) and ensure that the kitchen is clean after dinner (including washing dishes, mopping, etc). Our steward, the person we put in charge of organizing waitings and purchasing food, makes sure that at least two experienced cooks are on each team in order for waitings to run smoothly. Waitings typically run from 4:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Having this system not only saves money, but also allows us to provide the meal-plan at a fraction of the cost of a campus meal-plan. Additionally, this helps members learn how to cook and to work as a team. Many brothers gain satisfaction from being self-sufficient. For all weekday waitings, dinner is served in the dining room at 6:30 PM.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Local Chapter History</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/local-chapter-history/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/local-chapter-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>Late in the fall semester of 1946, a group of 15 members of the class of 1950 concerned themselves with the rather inevitable fate of separation and absorption by other group on campus. A small committee was appointed to investigate possibilities of organizing a new fraternity with the goal of keeping this group and its ideals intact. It was touch and go for several months while some of the members plunged ahead with the business at hand, others remaining undecided. Finally, when a constitution and working organization were readied, there were 13 men standing by to become members of what was first termed a club. With the election of officers in March of 1947, Phi Delta Rho came into being.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>National History</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/national-history/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/national-history/</guid><description>&lt;p>History can be presented in many forms. It can be written or oral. This historical outlook on the trials and triumphs of our Brotherhood was taken from articles which have appeared in the Garnet &amp;amp; White, from personal letters in the Fraternity’s archives, and from personal discussions with Brothers who shared their stories with us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The year was 1894. Grover Cleveland was the President of the United States. The country was starting to recover from the Economic Panic of 1893, which seriously jeopardized the monetary and fiscal policies of both the country and its individuals.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Our Properties</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/our-properties/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/about/our-properties/</guid><description>&lt;p>Alpha Chi Rho consists of three houses on 4 property lots located between Tibbits Ave. and Highland Ave. We are located approximately two blocks from the main campus, making it an easy walk to and from class. Every room has a Cable TV connection and also a high speed internet port for each brother. The House will supply each room with a desk, bed, and chair, although many brothers choose to provide their own for reasons of comfort. Brothers are also free to modify rooms to suit their needs, whether it be lofting beds, adding futons, or simply repainting. The property is owned by the Delta Phi Building Association and rented to the undergraduate chapter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Postulancy</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/faqs/postulancy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/faqs/postulancy/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="what-is-postulancy">What is Postulancy?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>New members do not pledge Alpha Chi Rho. Instead, they enter into postulancy,which is a period in which one is an uneducated equal. It takes time for new members to learn the history and ideals of the fraternity. This period will last approximately 8 weeks during which postulants are expected to learn what it means to be a brother. This includes participating in new member education classes, Rensselaer’s Greek Life 101 programming, community service, and other brotherhood events.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Why Go Greek?</title><link>http://www.rpicrows.com/faqs/why-go-greek/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Mar 2017 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.rpicrows.com/faqs/why-go-greek/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="friendship-and-brotherhood">Friendship and Brotherhood&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a member of Alpha Chi Rho, you will form friendships unlike those found in other organizations. Alpha Chi Rho is composed of members with a diverse set of interests from Capoeira to Jazz Ensemble to ROTC. Your brothers will grow to become your closest friends, those who will cheer you on when you’re successful and who will support you when the going gets tough. This unbreakable support system will allow for experiences in many activities that you wouldn’t attempt on your own.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
