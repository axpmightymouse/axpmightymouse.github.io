Membership numbers have been dwindling due to increased difficulties in recruitment during the pandemic. Both the pandemic and RPI’s policies have reduced the number of Brothers currently living in our Houses creating significant detrimental consequences on both the fraternal and financial aspects of our Chapter.</p><p>During the initial stages of the pandemic in Spring 2020, all students were sent home and thus the Building Association was unable to collect rent. Furthermore, the following year, Fall 2020-Spring 2021, RPI adopted online classes, so most of the undergraduate Brothers did not return to the Chapter, and again minimal rent was collected. Further exacerbating the lack of income, recruitment efforts over these semesters were very difficult and more Brothers graduated than have been newly initiated. The Building Association has taken a massive loss in finances over these past two years as we continue to pay for our required expenses and receive minimal income through rent.</p><p>At present, because of low membership numbers at the Chapter, many of the current Brothers cannot afford the increase in rent needed to meet the Chapter’s expenses. This is leading some undergraduate Brothers to seek living accommodations elsewhere. If Brothers choose not to live-in at Alpha Chi Rho due to cost, it robs them of valuable life experiences that can only be learned through our fraternal way of life and also passes an additional monetary burden to the remaining Brothers.</p><p>For these reasons, the Building Association, in conjunction with the Rensselaer Crow Alumni Foundation, is starting a major fundraising effort, The COVID-19 Relief Fundraiser, to support the Chapter, to recover from the effects of the pandemic, and to allow Alpha Chi Rho to prosper in the years to come. There are two milestone goals that we have established:</p><ul><li>Raise $36,000 to (a) provide urgent financial assistance to the Undergraduate Chapter to ensure housing costs remain competitive with other housing options in Troy; (b) assist in attracting new Brothers; and (c) pay off the remaining balance on the mortgage for Taylor House. Paying off the mortgage will eliminate all liabilities on the Building Association’s properties and provide us with a stronger financial position to work with the Undergraduate Chapter.</li><li>Raise $90,000 to recoup the Building Association’s financial losses due to the pandemic. This will allow us to continue to provide needed support for the Undergraduate Chapter. Our strong financial position prior to the pandemic has allowed us to continue operations throughout these difficult times, when many other chapters have closed their doors due to financial issues.</li></ul><p>We are asking for your help in supporting these fundraising efforts. Donations can be made directly to the Rensselaer Crow Alumni Foundation (RCAF) via the following options:</p><ul><li><p>Visit the <a href=https://rpicrows.com/donate/>Donate</a> page to find the link to the PayPal Donate Now button. There is a 3.23% processing fee from PayPal, which you have the option to pay instead of passing on to the RCAF.</p></li><li><p>Mail a check payable to “RCAF” to the following address:</p><p>RCAF<br>PO Box 222<br>Atglen, PA 19310</p><p>This goes to Matt Kehoe ‘86, the Treasurer of the RCAF. We recommend this option for larger donations to avoid paying the PayPal processing fee.</p></li></ul><p>We ask that you donate directly through the RCAF since 100% of this money will go directly to supporting Alpha Chi Rho. All donations to the RCAF are tax deductible and are eligible for corporate matching. Also, the RCAF can accept donations from an IRA as part of a required minimum disbursement (RMD) and the RCAF is qualified to receive donations from Donor Advised Funds.</p><p>Since our founding in 1948, we have inducted over 900 Brothers into our Chapter. If every graduate Brother would donate just $100, we will meet all goals of this fundraising effort!</p><p>In the Bond,
Members of the Building Association and Rensselaer Crow Alumni Foundation</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=http://www.rpicrows.com/>&copy; RPI Crows 2025</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
