We are happy to announce that with the generous donations that we have received thus far over these past few weeks we have already met our first goal of raising over $36K! These funds will provide much needed support to our Chapter as we recover from this crisis, and we are well on our way of ensuring that Alpha Chi Rho will always be there for our alumni Brothers, our current undergraduate Brothers, and our future Brothers.</p><p>We still need your help to reach our second goal of $90K which will reposition our Chapter back to our pre-pandemic financial levels so we can tackle much needed maintenance work on our properties, reinforce our recruitment efforts to attract a new generation of Brothers, and strengthen our scholarship funds to provide support for our undergraduate Brothers. Every donation, no matter the size, will make a difference.</p><p>So please consider continuing to support our COVID-19 Relief Fundraiser. Donations can be made directly to the Rensselaer Crow Alumni Foundation (RCAF) via the following options:</p><ul><li><p>Visit the <a href=https://rpicrows.com/donate/>Donate</a> page to find the link to the PayPal Donate Now button. There is a 3.23% processing fee from PayPal, which you have the option to pay instead of passing on to the RCAF.</p></li><li><p>Mail a check payable to “RCAF” to the following address:</p><p>RCAF<br>PO Box 222<br>Atglen, PA 19310</p><p>This goes to Matt Kehoe ‘86, the Treasurer of the RCAF. We recommend this option for larger donations to avoid paying the PayPal processing fee.</p></li></ul><p>Remember, all donations to the RCAF are tax deductible and are eligible for corporate matching. Also, the RCAF can accept donations from an IRA as part of a required minimum disbursement (RMD) and the RCAF is qualified to receive donations from Donor Advised Funds.</p><p>In the Bond,
