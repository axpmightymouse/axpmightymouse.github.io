Donations can be made directly to the Rensselaer Crow Alumni Foundation (RCAF) via the following options:</p><ul><li><p>Visit the <a href=https://rpicrows.com/donate/>Donate</a> page to find the link to the PayPal Donate Now button. There is a 3.23% processing fee from PayPal, which you have the option to pay instead of passing on to the RCAF.</p></li><li><p>Mail a check payable to “RCAF” to the following address:</p><p>RCAF<br>PO Box 222<br>Atglen, PA 19310</p><p>This goes to Matt Kehoe ‘86, the Treasurer of the RCAF. We recommend this option for larger donations to avoid paying the PayPal processing fee.</p><p>Remember, all donations to the RCAF are tax deductible and are eligible for corporate matching. Also, the RCAF can accept donations from an IRA as part of a required minimum disbursement (RMD) and the RCAF is qualified to receive donations from Donor Advised Funds.</p></li></ul><p>If you have any questions, please reach out to the following people:</p><p>Adam Metzler (‘06), BA President (<a href=mailto:adzler514@gmail.com>adzler514@gmail.com</a>)</p><p>Andrew Ewing (‘12), RCAF President and BA Treasurer (<a href=mailto:ajewing22@gmail.com>ajewing22@gmail.com</a>)</p><p>Matt Kehoe (‘86), RCAF Treasurer (<a href=mailto:mattkehoe@kehoeco.com>mattkehoe@kehoeco.com</a>)</p><p>In the Bond,
